Marriage is the most natural state of man, and... the state in which you will find solid happiness.
It is not good that the man should be alone.
A career is wonderful, but you can't curl up with it on a cold night.
Marriage, in its truest sense, is a partnership of equals, with neither exercising dominion over the other, but, rather, with each encouraging and assisting the other in whatever responsibilities and aspirations he or she might have.
The real act of marriage takes place in the heart, not in the ballroom or church or synagogue. It's a choice you make - not just on your wedding day, but over and over again - and that choice is reflected in the way you treat your husband or wife.
